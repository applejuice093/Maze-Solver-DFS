# Maze-Solver-DFS
his project is a C++ application that solves maze images using Depth First Search (DFS). The maze is provided as a PNG file, which is processed through file handling. The program reads the maze structure, applies DFS to explore possible paths, and identifies a valid route from the start point to the exit.
